That order was not signed until April 14 — twenty-seven days later and two days before this hearing.\n\nThe Third Complaint for Contempt was filed on April 4. The order it references did not exist as a signed document on that date. It did not exist on April 7 when the hearing was noticed. It was signed nunc pro tunc on April 14.\n\nA party cannot be held in contempt for violating an order that was not signed until ten days after the complaint was filed. Nunc pro tunc corrects the record of what was ordered — it does not create retroactive contempt liability. Del-Cook Timber, 248 Ga. App. 734.\n\nAdditionally, the order contains factual errors. Paragraph 10 states I earned $97,000 annually. My W-2 reflects $74,627.59. It states I voluntarily resigned under DOGE initiatives. I am a DoD civilian engineering technician with FERS Disability Retirement pending — not military, not a voluntary resignation.\n\nI have complied with every evaluation this Court directed. Dr. Maughon confirmed autism and ADHD on March 24. No bipolar disorder. No mania. I produced discovery on March 26 and supplemented it on April 14. I have zero income and receive SNAP and Medicaid.\n\nI am not asking this Court to set aside the April 14 order. I am asking this Court to dismiss the Third Complaint for Contempt because it predates the order it cites. And I am asking to exercise the supervised visitation provided in paragraph 6 of that order this Saturday. My mother is available to supervise. I am asking to see my children.",
