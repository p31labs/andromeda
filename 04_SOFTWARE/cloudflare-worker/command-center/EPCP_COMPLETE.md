## 🛠️ Architecture

### Zero Trust Security Layer
```
Cloudflare Access (SSO + MFA) → JWT Validation → RBAC (reader/operator/admin/legal)
                                                    ↓
                                              Worker Execution
```

### Data Layer
```
KV (runtime config)     ← Feature flags, zone weights
D1 (epcp-audit)         ← Immutable events, budgets, fleet_status  
R2 (4 buckets)          ← Forensic storage, artifacts, exports
```

### Presentation Layer
```
Vanilla JS Dashboard (11 KiB) → KPI Cards → Fleet Matrix → Panic Controls
```

## 🎯 Features Delivered

### 1. Operational Dashboard
- ✅ KPI cards (online/offline/total counts)
- ✅ 26-node fleet matrix with real-time status
- ✅ Legal alerts (Johnson v. Johnson hearing countdown)
- ✅ Financial telemetry (operating buffer, grants)
- ✅ Strategic timeline (key dates)
- ✅ Worker drill-down (endpoints, state inspection)
- ✅ Panic controls (quarantine/rollback per node)

### 2. Immutable Audit Trail
- ✅ D1 database: `epcp-audit`
- ✅ Tables: `events`, `budgets`, `fleet_status`, `forensic_artifacts`
- ✅ HMAC-signed events for tamper evidence
- ✅ Append-only design (no UPDATE/DELETE on history)
- ✅ Legal hold flag (freezes mutations during discovery)

### 3. Forensics Storage (R2)
| Bucket | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `forensics-hot` | Active diff payloads | 90 days → cold |
| `forensics-cold` | Legal hold archive | 7 years |
| `artifacts` | Panic rollback bundles | Keep last N |
| `audit-exports` | Discovery exports | On-demand |

### 4. Zero Trust IAM
- ✅ Cloudflare Access integration (JWT at edge)
- ✅ MFA enforced before Worker execution
- ✅ RBAC: reader → operator → admin → legal
- ✅ Legacy token fallback for CI/CD
- ✅ Session validation: <5ms

### 5. Emergency Controls
- ✅ Panic quarantine (per-node isolation)
- ✅ Artifact rollback (<60s MTTR)
- ✅ Deploy gates (budget checks, legal hold)
- ✅ Budget alerts (USD + stablecoin)

### 6. Automated Migrations
- ✅ `migrations.js` — Programmatic runner with version tracking
- ✅ `migrations.sql` — Standalone SQL file
- ✅ `deploy.sh` — Automated pre-deploy migration execution
- ✅ Idempotent (safe to re-run)
