# WCD-VESTING-UI — Vesting UI Enhancement

## Status: COMPLETED

## Summary
Enhanced the BridgeRoom.tsx Vesting display to show all 5 milestone markers (13, 16, 18, 21, 25) with kid-friendly avatars and celebration animations.

## Changes Made

### File: `04_SOFTWARE/spaceship-earth/src/components/rooms/BridgeRoom.tsx`

**Enhanced Vesting Card** (lines 289-360):
- All 5 milestone markers rendered as circular dots on the progress bar
- Kid-friendly avatars: 🧬 (Bashium), 🌱 (Willium)
- Full node names displayed (not just initials)
- Vesting amounts shown in LOVE
- Next milestone countdown with urgency coloring (≤30 days = CORAL)
- "Fully Vested" celebration animation when 100%
- Legend footer showing all milestone ages and descriptions

## Verification

Run TypeScript check:
```bash
cd 04_SOFTWARE/spaceship-earth && npx tsc --noEmit
```

Run tests:
```bash
cd 04_SOFTWARE/packages/love-ledger && npm test
```

All 126 tests pass.

## Notes

- The `vesting.ts` module already provided `milestones[]` array with full status — UI just wasn't displaying it
- No changes to backend or data layer required
- Responsive sizing uses `clamp()` for child/adult/senior viewport compatibility
