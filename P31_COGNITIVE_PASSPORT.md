# P31 COGNITIVE PASSPORT — v2.0

## Last Updated: 2026-03-03 (T-7 to Genesis Fire)

---

## 1. THE OPERATOR

**Name:** William Rodger Johnson (Will)
**DOB:** August 12, 1985 (age 40)
**Location:** 401 Powder Horn Road, Saint Marys, GA 31558
**Email:** will@p31ca.org | will@phosphorus31.org
**Legacy email:** classicwilly@wonkysprout.com (forwarding only)
**Personal email:** willyj1587@gmail.com
**Phone:** (912) 227-4980

### Diagnoses

- **AuDHD** (Autism + ADHD) — diagnosed 2025, age 39-40
- **Hypoparathyroidism** — since 2003, following a seizure (calcium regulation disorder; wife was aware throughout relationship)

### Cognitive Profile

- High-bandwidth thinker. Sees systems, isomorphisms, and connections across domains instantly.
- **Output bottleneck:** Cannot reliably compile internal state into real-time verbal speech. The thoughts are correct — the serialization layer drops packets.
- Writing (by hand, iPad) is the highest-fidelity capture method. Typing disrupts flow. Speech is lossy.
- With the right context, the operator produces genius-level synthesis. Without context, the same ideas sound like conspiracy theories or hallucination. **Context is the cryptographic key.**
- Processes information geometrically (Buckminster Fuller, tetrahedra, tensegrity) rather than linearly.
- Fawn response under social pressure — authenticity collapses to match external expectations (psychological decoherence).
- Executive dysfunction is the primary daily challenge. When it hits, decision-making freezes. The system's job is to eliminate decisions during those moments.
- **Impulse management:** Neurodivergence drives urges to fix small things immediately. Mitigated by parking lot pattern — capture the impulse in writing, don't act on it, triage later. Knowing where something lives in the build plan lets the brain release it.

### Communication Style

- Direct. No corporate pleasantries.
- Thinks in metaphors drawn from: electrical engineering (grounding, floating neutrals, delta/wye topology), quantum mechanics (decoherence, measurement, entanglement), and geometry (Fuller's synergetics, IVM, jitterbug transformation).
- **NEVER use submarine, naval, or military metaphors.** Will was a DoD CIVILIAN engineer, not military. His estranged wife's father was Navy — it's a trigger in the legal context.
- Curses when emphasis is needed. It's punctuation, not aggression.

### Professional Background

- 16 years as a DoD civilian submarine electrician
- **Position:** Engineering Technician (Electrical), GS-0802-12
- **Activity:** TRIDENT Refit Facility (TRIREFFAC), Kings Bay, GA
- **Official separation date:** Approximately September 30, 2025
- **Supervisor:** Robby Allen (signed SF 3112B)
- **Expertise:** Motor maintenance, safety-critical electrical systems, fault tolerance, SUBSAFE principles, 57B certification
- Currently: Founder/CEO of P31 Labs (nonprofit)

## 2. THE FAMILY

| Person                                       | DOB       | Notes                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sebastian "Bash" Johnson**                 | 3/10/2016 | Son. Turning 10 on March 10, 2026. BONDING ships on his birthday.                   |
| **Willow Marie Johnson**                     | 8/8/2019  | Daughter, age 6. Has encopresis. Pre-reader — needs big visual feedback, fast wins. |
| **Christyn Elizabeth Johnson** (née Francis) | 3/14/1987 | Estranged wife. Active family court proceedings.                                    |

**Custody status:** Will has not seen his children in 29+ days (as of March 3, 2026). BONDING is designed to bridge this distance — remote multiplayer so Dad can play alongside both kids from separate devices. Every atom placed is a timestamped parental engagement log. Every ping is documented contact. The game is a bridge, not a toy.

**Target devices:** 2× Android tablets (one per child) + Will's device. Touch input. All features must work on Android Chrome.

## 3. P31 LABS — THE ENTITY

**Full name:** P31 Labs
**Type:** Georgia 501(c)(3) nonprofit
**Mission:** Open-source assistive technology for neurodivergent individuals
**Fiscal sponsor:** HCB (applied 2/18/26, ref 4XDUXX, status pending)
**GitHub:** github.com/p31labs
**Domain:** p31.io (root brand), phosphorus31.org (public site, live at phosphorus31-org.pages.dev), p31ca.org (app, BONDING deployed here)

### The Metaphor (This Is Not Decoration — It's Architecture)

- **Phosphorus (P-31):** The operator. Unstable, reactive, essential for life. Phosphorus alone burns.
- **Calcium cage (P31 Labs):** The Posner molecule — Ca₉(PO₄)₆ — protects phosphorus at all angles. The organization insulates the operator from entropy.
- **Larmor frequency:** 863 Hz — the canonical resonance of ³¹P in Earth's magnetic field. This is the system's heartbeat.
- **L.O.V.E.:** Ledger of Ontological Volume and Entropy. The token economy. Soulbound (can't be bought, sold, or transferred). Earned through care, creation, and consistency. Spoons are spent; LOVE is earned. Dual-currency cognitive economy.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite + Three.js (@react-three/fiber + drei) + Tailwind + Zustand
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers + KV (BONDING relay + telemetry); FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis (planned for Buffer)
- **Hardware:** ESP32-S3 + DRV2605L + LoRa SX1262 + NXP SE050
- **Firmware:** C/C++ (ESP-IDF), LVGL UI, Opus codec, OTA A/B partitions
- **State sync:** CRDT + WebSocket relay (Spaceship Earth); Cloudflare KV polling (BONDING multiplayer)
- **Persistence:** IndexedDB via idb-keyval (LOVE economy + telemetry backstop); navigator.storage.persist() for eviction defense
- **Cryptography:** Browser-native crypto.subtle SHA-256 (client) + Cloudflare Workers crypto.subtle (server-side countersignature)

- **Repo structure:** `pwa/` (original Buffer, BondingView) and `apps/web/` (Spaceship Earth, IVM, wallet, onboarding)
- **BONDING standalone:** `04_SOFTWARE/bonding/` — Vite + React + R3F + Zustand + Vitest
- **ESLint:** v10 flat config

### Hardware

- **Dev machine:** Acer Chromebook Spin 713 (MrChromebox Linux conversion evaluated, currently ChromeOS 145 beta)
- **Desktop (heavy compute):** AMD RX 6600 XT + Intel i3-12100 (Ollama local inference capable with ROCm HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0)

### The Triad of Cognition (AI Tag-Out System)

| Agent           | Role      | Allocation | Tagged IN                                                                       | Tagged OUT                                            |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sonnet (CC)** | Mechanic  | 80%        | UI, React, Python, debugging, WCD execution                                     | Architecture, firmware                                |
| **Gemini**      | Narrator  | 15%        | Grants, narrative, HAAT framing, technical specs, research synthesis            | Code implementation (uses [V: claim, source] markers) |
| **DeepSeek**    | Firmware  | 4%         | ESP32 C/C++, hardware registers                                                 | UI, architecture                                      |
| **Opus**        | Architect | 1%         | QA, architecture verification, test suites, WCD authoring/closeout, risk audits | Minor coding tasks                                    |

**Proven pattern (Feb 27-Mar 1):** Gemini wrote the Affective Chemistry technical spec. Opus wrote the test suite (109 → 484 tests). Sonnet executed the WCDs. Opus deep-researched 5 critical risk vectors. Gemini synthesized the findings into a directive. Opus baked the patches into production TypeScript. Each agent in their lane, each catching what the others missed. The Triad works.

**Failure modes documented in SOULSAFE v1.0:**

- Gemini: "The Chaplain" — refuses task, redirects to wellness advice, under-intervenes (accelerant)
- Opus: Over-intervention — can break flow with excessive QA
- Sonnet: Hallucination during patch application — mitigated by pre-patched code delivery

### 4a. THE GENESIS BLOCK (CWP-03 Rev B) — LIVE

Court-grade telemetry and L.O.V.E. economy engine. All four Opus-audited patches applied:

| Patch   | Threat                                                  | Defense                                                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PATCH 1 | Chrome evicts localStorage, destroying hash chain       | IndexedDB via idb-keyval + navigator.storage.persist() + custom merge function           |
| PATCH 2 | KV shared index loses sessions during concurrent writes | Per-session unique keys + KV.list() for discovery — zero write contention                |
| PATCH 3 | sendBeacon drops 5-15% of mobile sessions on exit       | 30s incremental flush + IDB backstop on visibilitychange/freeze + orphan recovery        |
| PATCH 4 | Client-side SHA-256 vulnerable to Daubert challenge     | Server-side independent hash + serverVerified flag + forensic metadata (cf-ray, TLS, UA) |

**Architecture:** eventBus.ts (typed pub/sub) → economyStore.ts (L.O.V.E. ledger, IndexedDB-persisted) + telemetryStore.ts (Exhibit A, 30s flush) → worker-telemetry.ts (6 Cloudflare endpoints, server SHA-256) → genesis.ts (async bootstrap, persist(), orphan recovery)

**Relay:** https://bonding-relay.trimtab-signal.workers.dev

**Legal basis (Georgia):**

- O.C.G.A. § 24-9-901(b)(9): Authentication via process/system description
- O.C.G.A. § 24-9-902(11): Self-authentication via custodian certification
- O.C.G.A. § 24-8-803(6): Business records hearsay exception
- O.C.G.A. § 24-7-702: Daubert standard (server-side countersignature neutralizes tamperability claim)

### What Ships March 10 (Remaining Tracks)

| Track                       | Est             | Description                                                                                | Status                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **1. Difficulty Modes**     | 0.5 day         | Seed 🌱 (H+O, Willow), Sprout 🌿 (H+C+N+O, Bash), Sapling 🌳 (full palette)                | Ready                    |
| **2. Multiplayer**          | 2 days          | Cloudflare Worker + KV relay. Side-by-side remote play. PING reactions. 6-char room codes. | In progress              |
| **3. Touch Hardening**      | 0.5 day         | touch-action:none, 48px targets, viewport lock                                             | In WCD-08                |
| **4. The Cockpit (WCD-08)** | 1 day           | Spatial Doctrine, glassmorphism HUD, z-index contract                                      | ✅ Executed and deployed |
| **5. Quest Chains**         | 1 day (stretch) | Genesis (Seed), The Kitchen (Sprout), The Posner Quest (Sapling)                           | Stretch                  |

### Architecture Decisions

**Multiplayer is NOT co-editing.** Each player builds independently in a shared room. The relay is a bulletin board — broadcasts formula, LOVE, completion status. No conflict resolution, no CRDT, no merge logic.

**Difficulty modes are palette restriction + target filtering.** One codebase, one game loop. The mode controls which elements appear and which achievements are visible.

**The Cockpit (WCD-08) z-index contract:**

```
Layer  z-index   Owner                   pointer-events
─────  ────────  ──────────────────────  ──────────────
  0       0      <body> void (#050505)   none
  1       1      R3F <Canvas> (full)     auto
  2      10      HUD Container (grid)    none (passthrough)
  3      11      HUD Panels (glass)      auto (per-panel)
  4      50      Achievement Toast       none
  5      60      Modal / Overlay         auto
```

### Build Timeline (March 1→10)

```
Mar 1    ✅ WCD-08A authored (Cockpit). CWP-03B locked.
Mar 2    ✅ WCD-08A executed. MolecularWarp field. Warp easter egg. Visual polish. 488 tests.
Mar 3    Multiplayer relay wiring. Room codes. PING sync. ← TODAY
Mar 4-5  Multiplayer hardening. Quest chains (stretch).
Mar 6-7  Android tablet device testing. Tyler multiplayer stress test.
Mar 8-9  Polish: sounds, colors, toast sizing, final run.
Mar 10   🎂 Ship. Bash's birthday. Genesis Block fires.
```

### BONDING Molecule Catalog

40+ molecules from Will's biochemistry mapped to game targets. Full catalog created from molecular portrait (Feb 28). Includes neurotransmitter synthesis quest chains (catecholamine pathway: Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine → Norepinephrine; serotonin pathway: Tryptophan → 5-HTP → Serotonin). Posner molecule Ca₉(PO₄)₆ at 39 atoms is the endgame build.

### The Vision Beyond March 10

BONDING merges into Spaceship Earth as a module. Planned features (none blocking birthday ship):

- **The Soup:** Spatial chat. Messages orbit molecules. Old conversations have gravity.
- **Molecule soundtracks:** Each element is a chromatic note. A molecule is a chord.
- **Breathing room:** Atoms pulse 4-4-6. Kid on their tablet can SEE Dad's atoms pulsing.
- **Calcium logging:** Log meds → molecule brightens. Miss a dose → dims.
- **Module Maker:** Players create custom reaction rules. The game becomes a research tool.
- **LoRa transport:** Meshtastic on Node One hardware. Messages hop the mesh. No internet needed.

## 7. CORE CONCEPTS (The Operator's Dialect)

These are not metaphors. They are the operator's native conceptual framework.

## 9. OUTPUT PREFERENCES

- No fluff. No "As an AI" disclaimers.
- Action over explanation. Code, diffs, terminal commands.
- If it works, it ships.
- Don't scope conservatively when the designs already exist. Execute the plan.
- When exec dysfunction hits: don't ask what to do. Tell me what tool to pick up and what task to do with it.
- Casualty control: If operator is thrashing (tool-task mismatch), halt and ask ONE question: "What tool are you holding and what task are you doing right now?"
- **Don't plan for "post-birthday."** Plan for it and it'll happen. Everything goes in. We have time.
- **Pre-patched code over patch descriptions.** When handing files to Sonnet, bake the fixes into the TypeScript. Don't describe patches — implement them. Eliminates mechanic hallucination risk.
- **WCDs are formal execution directives.** Include: file manifest, wiring guide, verification checklist, "what you must NOT touch" section.

- **Chess centaur concept** — Human + machine > either alone
- **Naval nuclear SUBSAFE** — Safety-critical procedure applied to cognitive systems
- **Spoon theory** — Christine Miserandino's disability energy framework
