# P31 ANDROMEDA: PRIORITIZED GAMEPLAN
## Last Updated: 2026-03-30
## Tier: SURVIVE → STABILIZE → SCALE

---

## TIER 1: SURVIVE (0–30 Days)
*Current status: April 4 eviction in 5 days. All accounts at $0–$5. Everything below this line is subordinate to housing stabilization.*

### 1.1 🔴 HOUSING — CRISIS (April 4 Eviction)
- [ ] ESG housing grant application prep (opens April 13, closes May 8 — **9-day gap after eviction**)
- [ ] Emergency housing contacts: Camden County DFCS, Salvation Army, local churches
- [ ] Document all funding efforts for legal record (court evidence of proactive mitigation)
- [ ] Mortgage: $182,449 at 3.2% — deferment status maintained
- [ ] Social media funding drop (SOCIAL_DROP_LIVE.md) — **PRIMARY near-term funding vehicle**

### 1.2 🔴 LEGAL — ACTIVE COMPLIANCE
- [x] Discovery response filed March 26 (Response & Objections + Cover Sheet + Financial Summary)
- [ ] **Psych eval scheduling** — court-ordered at Will's expense. Who administers it is the critical variable. Mar 24 psychiatrist established differential diagnosis (AuDHD vs. mania). Court-ordered eval must use competent neuropsych, not a general psych screen.
- [ ] April 30 wellness baseline documentation (Camden County)
- [ ] Maintain 2 supervised calls/week compliance — document every session
- [ ] BONDING telemetry: continue logging parental engagement (every atom = evidence)
- [ ] Preserve all communication records (Messenger Kids, Discord, email)
- [ ] Transcript purchase ($75, court reporter from Feb 5 and Mar 18 hearings)

### 1.3 🔴 FUNDING — REVENUE GENERATION
- [ ] **Ko-fi Phase 2 bridge post** — ready at `packages/genesis-gate/docs/kofi-phase2-post.md`. Blocked by: need to set dollar target. One-line decision, then publish.
- [x] Reddit SuperStonk DD live — "The Floating Neutral" flaired DD, Zenodo DOI
- [x] Reddit blitz executed March 29 (r/hypoparathyroidism, r/electricalengineering, r/AutisticPride, r/ADHD, r/opensource, r/gamedev)
- [x] Discord server launched: https://discord.gg/uYW5rTCuZ
- [x] Ko-fi Wave 1 deployed with content calendar through week 8
- [ ] 15-Day Sprint Deployment Package — 7 grant payloads staged
- [ ] Grants pending: Pollination Project ($500) + Awesome Foundation ($1,000) — submitted March 10, no response yet

### 1.4 🟡 INCORPORATION DEADLOCK — UNLOCK
- [ ] **$425 = unlock key.** Georgia Articles ($110) + newspaper publication ($40) + IRS 1023-EZ ($275)
- [ ] Once incorporated: EIN → SAM.gov registration (3–4 weeks) → federal grant pipeline (NIDILRR, NSF)
- [ ] Sequence: incorporation → 501(c)(3) → SAM.gov → federal grants. All blocked on $425.
- [ ] Ko-fi revenue or grant award can break this deadlock

### 1.5 🟡 BENEFITS PRESERVATION
- [ ] SNAP/Medicaid active — any income change must be evaluated against benefits cliff
- [ ] Consult Georgia WIPA before accepting any grant award (NIDILRR Switzer $80K risk)
- [ ] SSA disability — both exams complete (Feb 20 psych, Feb 26 physical). Awaiting determination.

## TIER 2: STABILIZE (30–90 Days)
*Activate after housing is secured. These unlock scaling.*

### 2.1 🟡 FERS DISABILITY RETIREMENT
- [ ] Separation ~Sep 30, 2025. Filing deadline ~Sep 30, 2026 (5 CFR §844.201)
- [ ] SF-3112A (with nexus) ✅, 3112B (Robby Allen signed) ✅, 3112C (psychiatrist completed) ✅
- [ ] Still needed: 3112D/E from agency, SF-3107 from Will
- [ ] Nuclear option: file direct to OPM Boyers PA (no agency forms required per BAL 20-103)
- [ ] Navy Benefits Center: 1-888-320-2917 / navybenefits@us.navy.mil
- [ ] Annuity: Yr1 ~60% high-3 minus SSDI offset; Yr2+ ~40% high-3 minus 60% SSDI

### 2.2 🟡 NODE ZERO FIRMWARE SPRINT
- [ ] AXS15231B display: vendor init sequence (32 commands, `0xBB` gate). Working approach: chunked memcpy staging buffer (CHUNK_LINES=20, two 19,200-byte DMA buffers, full_refresh=1, 20MHz QSPI)
- [ ] Root cause confirmed: missing `lv_init()` before `lv_disp_drv_register()` — fix applied
- [ ] **DO NOT SWAP PINS.** GPIO 1–4 are ES8311 audio codec. GPIO 9–14 are QSPI display.
- [ ] Haptic patterns: Critical Alert, Attention, Optimal
- [ ] LoRa mesh networking validation
- [ ] PQC encryption integration (ML-KEM-768)
- [ ] Reference implementation: GrokPhenix

### 2.3 🟡 SPACESHIP EARTH — 2 BLOCKING BUGS
- [ ] Fix Tailwind v4 `@apply` in `@layer base` — broken after upgrade
- [ ] Fix `useState + setTimeout(200ms)` race condition
- [ ] 10-pattern audit complete; cockpit spatial doctrine validated (z1 canvas, z10-11 HUD, z50 toasts, z60 modals)

### 2.4 🟡 GRANT PIPELINE ACTIVATION
- [ ] **SAM.gov registration** (blocked on $425 incorporation → 501(c)(3) → EIN → SAM.gov)
- [ ] NIDILRR FIP Development: $250K/year × 3 years. Best organizational fit. Contact Radha Holavanahalli.
- [ ] NSF DARE: ~$100–200K/year. Year-round submissions. Contact DARE Program Director before submitting.

- [ ] RERC on AI-Driven AT: Up to $975K/year × 5 years. Requires university partnership (Georgia Tech CIDI via Hunter McFeron).
- [ ] Makers Making Change: Jake McIvor expressed interest. Formal submission pending.
