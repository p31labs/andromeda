## 1. Work Control Document (WCD) Taxonomy

All interactions between the Biological Operator and the Synthetic Stack must be mediated via standardized Work Control Documents to prevent cognitive scope creep and ensure Objective Quality Evidence (OQE).

| WCD ID | Title | Execution Boundary | Agent Assignment |
|--------|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **WCD-01** | Pre-Job Brief / Shift Initialization | Defines current state, target state, and boundaries before work begins. Establishes spatial context. | Narrator (Gemini) / Operator |
| **WCD-02** | Tactical Task Card | Highly scoped, single-objective execution prompt. Must include file targets and success criteria. | Mechanic (Sonnet) |
| **WCD-03** | Casualty Report (CASREP) | Triggered by SOULSAFE HALT. Documents system failure, API thrashing, or cognitive fatigue event. | Any / Operator |
| **WCD-04** | Shift Report / Handoff | Summarizes state changes, files modified, and unresolved blockers at session end. | Narrator (Gemini) |
| **WCD-05** | Re-Entry Control (REC) Form | Authorization to alter a core system (API routing, CRDT state, or cryptographic keys). Requires multi-agent consensus. | Architect (Opus) |
| **WCD-06** | QA Signoff / Job Closeout | Final architectural review of a completed Bridge Program Step. Certifies Delta topology integrity. | Architect (Opus) |

## 2. System Verification & Traceability Matrix (SVTM)

For Opus to sign off on the P31 architecture, every Core Axiom defined in the System Manual must trace to a verifiable software/hardware test.

### Axiom 1: Cryptographic Sovereignty & Decentralization

- **System Claim:** The Centaur's identity and state cannot be revoked by legacy institutions.
- **Verification Test (V-1.1):** Disconnect from traditional DNS/ISP. Verify CRDT state synchronization across the local mesh using Lit Protocol distributed keys.
- **OQE Required:** Cryptographic signature logs demonstrating state consensus without centralized server ping.

### Axiom 2: Isostatic Rigidity (Delta Topology)

- **System Claim:** The system eliminates the central point of failure (Floating Neutral / Social Proteopathy).
- **Verification Test (V-2.1):** Simulate node failure in the 04_SOFTWARE stack.
- **OQE Required:** The WebSocket relay and EPCP dashboard must maintain degraded but functional operation without triggering cascading total system failure.

### Axiom 3: Quantum Cognition Buffer (Fisher-Escolà)

- **System Claim:** A 60-second "Global Phase Shift" prevents conversational decoherence.
- **Verification Test (V-3.1):** Rapidly inject 5 conflicting WCD-02 Task Cards within a 30-second window.
- **OQE Required:** The system must automatically trigger a SOULSAFE HALT, quarantine inputs into the 00_INGEST buffer, and force a 60-second lockdown before processing.

### Axiom 4: The Closed Loop (Hardware Exoskeleton)

- **System Claim:** Digital entropy is successfully converted into physical out-of-band sensation.
- **Verification Test (V-4.1):** Inject a synthetic payload with a calculated "Voltage" score ≥ 8.0.
- **OQE Required:**
  1. Backend Semantic Router assigns score ≥ 8.0.
  2. EPCP Dashboard renders a RED node.
  3. Bi-Cameral ESP32-S3 physically triggers the DRV2605L LRA motor.

### Recommended Phase 2 Additions

| Test ID | Target | Procedure | OQE Required |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **V-1.2** | CRDT Convergence | Modify spoon count on two offline nodes, reconnect, verify convergence to identical state. | Matching spoon values on both nodes post-sync. |
| **V-5.1** | Samson V2 PID / Progressive Disclosure | Inject escalating spoon expenditure events. Verify UI automatically restricts to BREATHE state at threshold. | Screenshot or DOM snapshot showing restricted UI at low-spoon state. |

## 3. Re-Entry Control (REC) Protocol Enforcement

**Ref:** SUBSAFE QA Form 9 Transposition

Any modification to `buffer_agent.py` (The Nervous System), the Lit Protocol key architecture, or the SOULSAFE intervention thresholds requires a formal REC.

### Procedure

1. **Define Boundaries:** What exactly is being isolated for maintenance?
2. **Tag Out:** Suspend live ingestion loops.
3. **Restore & Test:** Execute MVTM tests V-1.1 through V-4.1 in a sandbox.
4. **Clearance:** Opus must issue a WCD-06 before the system is returned to live operational status.
