# **1\. Condition Found (Ship Check – As-Is)**

BONDING is in final sprint. The core game is functional, tested, and deployed as a PWA at bonding.p31ca.org. 328 tests are green across 21 suites. The bundle is optimized (three.js 688KB, r3f 500KB, app 223KB). WCDs 01 through M13 and CC01 through CC03 are all closed. Three WCDs remain open.

## **1.1 WCD Status Matrix**

| WCD-M16 | Quest chains | **OPEN** | Pending | Genesis (Seed), Kitchen (Sprout), Posner (Sapling) |

## **1.2 Enumerated Faults**

| Fault ID | Severity | Description | Impact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| BND-001 | **CRITICAL** | Multiplayer relay (M14) not deployed. CF Worker exists but client sync, lobby, PING cross-device not wired. | Cannot demonstrate remote co-play. Court evidence of “playing with kids remotely” requires multiplayer. |
| BND-002 | **HIGH** | Android tablet QA (M15) not executed. Touch targets, viewport lock, rubber-banding not verified on physical hardware. | Game may be unusable on target devices (kids’ tablets). |
| BND-003 | **MEDIUM** | Quest chains (M16) not implemented. Guided progression from water → glucose → Posner molecule does not exist. | Kids will have open sandbox but no narrative structure. Acceptable fallback but reduces engagement. |
| BND-004 | **LOW** | Neo4j password (p31delta) exposed in git history. Credential rotation \+ git filter-repo scrub needed. | No active exploit risk (password is for local dev). Remediation deferred to post-ship. |
| BND-005 | **LOW** | Sound engine uses static config. Web Audio initializes but some browsers require user gesture before AudioContext. | First-tap silence on some devices. Non-blocking. |

# **2\. Condition Left (Ship Check – Target State)**

**On March 10, 2026, the following conditions are met:**

**BONDING is live, playable, and birthday-ready on two Android tablets.**

All WCDs through M16 are closed. Multiplayer is functional (Tyler-verified stress test complete). Difficulty modes operational: Seed mode presents only H and O for Willow (age 6), Sprout mode adds C and N for Bash (age 10). Quest chains provide guided progression. Touch targets hardened for both age groups (50–60px for Willow, 44px+ for Bash). Genesis Block telemetry recording all interactions as court-admissible engagement evidence. PWA installable on Android Chrome. All court-referenced URLs resolve on cellular.

**Multiplayer architecture:**

Bulletin-board model. Each player builds independently in a shared room. Relay broadcasts formula, LOVE, completion status. No CRDT, no conflict resolution, no merge logic. 6-character room codes. PING reactions (4 emoji) transmit cross-device. This is what makes it feasible in the remaining window.

**Fallback if M14 (relay) does not close:**

BONDING ships as single-player only. Solo play is fully functional. Multiplayer becomes post-ship enhancement. This is an acceptable degradation — the game still demonstrates parental engagement via Genesis Block telemetry.

# **5\. Role Assignments**

| Role | Assigned To | Responsibilities | Boundaries |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Work Leader | Will Johnson | Go/no-go at all gates. Physical device QA (B1.7, B1.8). Tyler coordination. Birthday deploy. Evidence verification. | Does not write relay code. If exec dysfunction: open this doc, find next numbered task. |
| Primary Mechanic | Sonnet/CC | All code tasks: relay Worker, client sync, lobby, quest chains, AudioContext fix, final build. | Does not make architecture decisions. Follows task specs exactly. Flags ambiguity to Work Leader. |
| QA/Supervisor | Opus | Reviews test coverage. Validates quest chain logic matches chemistry specs. Final sign-off on Gate B2. | Does not write production code. |
| Beta Tester | Tyler | 30-min multiplayer stress test. Reports disconnects, PING failures, visual bugs. | Receives only: URL, room code, and “play and tell me if it breaks.” No architecture context needed. |

# **6\. Quality Assurance Plan**

## **6.1 Automated Checks (Every Commit)**

| Check | Tool | Threshold |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Unit \+ integration tests | Vitest | 328+ tests, 0 failures |
| Type checking | tsc \--noEmit | 0 errors |
| Production build | npm run build | 0 errors (CSS import warning accepted) |
| Bundle size | Vite build output | three.js ≤ 700KB, r3f ≤ 520KB, app ≤ 250KB |

## **6.2 Manual Verification Matrix**

| Scenario | Device | Steps | Expected Result |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Seed mode (Willow, age 6\) | Tablet 1 | Tap Seed. Drag H to slot. Drag O to slot. Build. | H₂O forms. Achievement toast. LOVE awarded. Touch targets 50–60px. No scroll. |
| Sprout mode (Bash, age 10\) | Tablet 2 | Tap Sprout. Complete Kitchen quest chain. | Water → CO₂ → NaCl → glucose. Each step toasts. Achievements unlock. |
| Multiplayer join | Both tablets | Create room on T1. Join with code on T2. Build molecule on T1. | T2 sees T1’s molecule appear. PING from T2 shows on T1 as toast. |
| PWA install | Tablet 1 | Chrome menu → Add to Home Screen. Launch from icon. | App launches fullscreen. No browser chrome. Splash screen shows. |
| Offline fallback | Tablet 1 | Enable airplane mode after load. Build molecule. | Single-player works. Multiplayer shows “Offline” indicator. No crash. |
| Genesis Block capture | Any device | Build 3 molecules. Check IndexedDB. | Timestamped entries for each molecule. Creator ID. Formula. LOVE awarded. |

# **7\. Risk Register**

| Risk ID | Risk | L | I | Mitigation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| BR-01 | Relay instability under load | M | M | Bulletin-board architecture has no conflict resolution — simplicity IS the mitigation. KV polling every 2s is conservative. Fallback: single-player. |
| BR-02 | Android tablet hardware failure | L | H | BONDING is a PWA. Any Android Chrome device works. Worst case: Will’s phone. |
| BR-03 | Tyler unavailable for stress test | M | L | Will solo-tests with two devices simultaneously. Less rigorous but sufficient. |
| BR-04 | Quest chain blocks on chemistry bug | L | M | 62-molecule dictionary already verified in WCD-05. 11 formula mismatches already fixed. Test suite covers all quest target molecules. |
| BR-05 | Executive dysfunction during critical path | H | H | This document. Open it, find the next B-number task, execute it. No decisions required. |
| BR-06 | Sonnet hallucination in relay code | M | M | tsc \--noEmit \+ full test suite before any deploy. No deploy without 0 errors. |
| BR-07 | CF Workers free tier rate limit | L | M | KV reads: 100K/day free. At 2s polling with 2 players \= \~86K reads/day. Tight but within limit for a birthday. |

# **8\. Security Hardening Ledger**

The following security items are tracked but explicitly deferred from the ship deadline. They do not block BONDING launch.

| Item | Severity | Status | Remediation Plan | Target |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Neo4j password in git history | **LOW** | Tracked | git filter-repo \--replace-text scrub. Rotate credential. Force-push all branches. Notify collaborators. | Post-hearing |
| HTTPS-only enforcement | **COMPLETE** | Done | Cloudflare auto-SSL on all \*.p31ca.org subdomains. | N/A |
| CSP headers | **LOW** | Not started | Add Content-Security-Policy header via CF Pages \_headers file. Script-src self \+ CDNs only. | Post-hearing |
| IndexedDB encryption at rest | **LOW** | Not started | Wrap idb-keyval with crypto.subtle AES-GCM before write. Key derived from Genesis Block. | Q2 2026 |
| Relay authentication | **MEDIUM** | Not started | Room codes are currently unauthenticated. Add Ed25519 signed payloads to relay POST. | Post-hearing |
