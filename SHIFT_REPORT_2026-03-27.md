# Shift Report — 2026-03-27

## Operator
**Will Johnson** (P31 Labs)

## Shift Window
06:16 — 06:21 UTC (30 minutes)

## Work Completed

### 1. LOVE Economy Bridge Implementation

**Component**: `@p31/shared` economyStore + BONDING genesis

**Files Modified**:
- [`economyStore.ts`](04_SOFTWARE/packages/shared/src/economy/economyStore.ts) — Added `initLoveSync()` and `syncEarn()` fire-and-forget cloud sync
- [`economy/index.ts`](04_SOFTWARE/packages/shared/src/economy/index.ts) — Exported `initLoveSync`
- [`bonding/economyStore.ts`](04_SOFTWARE/bonding/src/genesis/economyStore.ts) — Re-exported `initLoveSync`
- [`genesis.ts`](04_SOFTWARE/bonding/src/genesis/genesis.ts) — Added stable device ID + initLoveSync call + PING→earnLove fix
- [`bonding/.env`](04_SOFTWARE/bonding/.env) — Added `VITE_LOVE_LEDGER_URL=`
- [`wrangler.toml`](04_SOFTWARE/workers/wrangler.toml) — Fixed main entry point, added routes placeholder

**Test Results**:
- love-ledger: 126/126 ✅
- BONDING: 413/413 ✅
- @p31/shared: tsc --noEmit ✅

### 2. PING Event Fix

**Issue**: PING_SENT and PING_RECEIVED events in genesis.ts only went to telemetry, never awarded LOVE

**Fix**: Added `earnLove('ping_sent')` and `earnLove('ping_received')` in event handlers

**Transaction Types**:
- ping_sent → CARE_GIVEN (5 LOVE)
- ping_received → CARE_RECEIVED (5 LOVE)

### 3. Ecosystem Analysis Document

**File**: [`P31_LOVE_ECONOMY_ANALYSIS.md`](P31_LOVE_ECONOMY_ANALYSIS.md)

**Sections**:
1. Tokenomics — dual currency (LOVE + Spoons), earn values, two-pool model
2. Consensus — local-first, DO serialization, TOCTOU mitigation
3. Smart Contract — worker endpoints, DO classes, D1 schema
4. Decentralization — current vs target (PGLite + Lit Protocol)
5. Economic Incentives — earn channels, spend mechanics, Node Count
6. Governance — 501(c)(3) structure, algorithmic (care score)
7. Transaction Flow — BONDING→cloud, spend flow
8. Liquidity — performance pool × care_score
9. Integration Points — BONDING, Spaceship Earth, future
10. Sustainability — economic, technical, legal

## OQE (Objective Quality Evidence)

| Evidence | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Tests pass (539 total) | Terminal output |
| TypeScript clean | tsc --noEmit |
| Implementation functional | Code review |
| Architecture documented | Analysis doc |

## Parking Lot Items

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Worker deployment | Manual — requires Cloudflare account |
| D1 database creation | Manual — requires wrangler CLI |
| Worker test suite | Not implemented |

## Notes

- All cloud sync is fire-and-forget — never blocks UI
- Stable device ID in localStorage persists across sessions
- 50/50 split to sovereignty/performance pools on every earn
- Care score modulates available spend (performance_pool × care_score)

## Next Shift

1. Deploy love-ledger worker to Cloudflare
2. Set VITE_LOVE_LEDGER_URL in BONDING
3. Run D1 migration (if live DB exists)
4. Consider worker test suite

## UPDATE 2026-03-27 06:31 UTC — DEPLOYED

Worker deployed successfully:
- URL: https://p31-workers.trimtab-signal.workers.dev
- Version ID: 0d5bbc16-72c1-4a18-98e9-c686802cdcce
- BONDING .env updated: VITE_LOVE_LEDGER_URL=https://p31-workers.trimtab-signal.workers.dev

**LOVE economy is now LIVE.** 🔺

## UPDATE 2026-03-27 06:56 UTC — CARE SCORE AUTOMATION

**Verification**: Audited claims in P31_LOVE_ECONOMY_ANALYSIS.md against actual code

**Claims Verified**:
| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| LOVE_VALUES in economyStore.ts | ✅ ACCURATE (lines 55-65) |
| LOVE_AMOUNTS in worker | ✅ ACCURATE (lines 92-102) |
| All worker endpoints | ✅ ACCURATE |
| Two-pool formula | ✅ ACCURATE |
| Care score decay | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED — gap found |
| initLoveSync export | ✅ EXISTS |
| PING discrepancy | ✅ DOCUMENTED |

**Gap Found**: Analysis claimed "increases with engagement, decreases with inactivity" for care score — but NO automation existed, only manual /care-score endpoint.

**Fix Implemented**:
1. Added `computeEffectiveCareScore()` function (lines 83-88)
   - 7-day grace period
   - -0.005/day decay, floor 0.1
2. Wired into getBalance, handleEarn, handleSpend, handleBalance
3. Added care_score bump on earn: +0.03 care-type, +0.005 passive

**Files Modified**:
- [`love-ledger.ts`](04_SOFTWARE/workers/love-ledger.ts) — Added care score automation

**Tests**: 539 tests green (BONDING 413 + love-ledger 126)

**Redeployed**: https://p31-workers.trimtab-signal.workers.dev (Version ID: 22ebc2e3-ceaa-4c57-8a16-8c5c8d8b2f13)

**Analysis Document Updated**:
- Fixed sovereignty pool section: "age-based vesting to founding nodes (S.J. + W.J.) — 10% at 13, 25% at 16, 50% at 18, 75% at 21, 100% at 25"
