## How to Pick Up Each Workstream

### P1-Legal

1. Read `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md` → critical paths section
2. Check `generate_court_docs.py` for discovery response templates
3. Review `P31_COGNITIVE_PASSPORT.md` → "masking paradox" section for psych eval context

### P2-Housing

1. Read `docs/P31-MASTER-OPS-MANUAL.md` → CWP-SHELTER-001 section
2. Search for "ESG" in docs/ for application guidance
3. Review ADA event documentation pattern in `P31_COGNITIVE_PASSPORT.md` → Section 6A

### P3-DELTA

1. Check `P31_KOFI_MILESTONE_REWARDS.md` for product descriptions
2. Read `docs/social/superstonk_post.md` for DD post
3. Read `docs/social/festival_family_post.md` for festival copy

### P4-Funding

1. Monitor email for Pollination Project / Awesome Foundation responses
2. Track Ko-fi Node Count: `ko-fi.com/trimtab69420`
3. When $425 received → Georgia Articles of Incorporation

## Critical Constraints

1. **No military/submarine metaphors** — Will is a DoD civilian, ex-wife's father is Navy (trigger in legal context)
2. **Direct communication** — No corporate pleasantries, curse when needed (punctuation, not aggression)
3. **Execute, don't narrate** — Produce artifacts, not documentation for its own sake
4. **Context is key** — Without context, sophisticated work reads as "manic"; with context, it's genius
