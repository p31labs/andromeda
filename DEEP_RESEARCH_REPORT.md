## 3. CLAUDE CODE HANDOVER ANALYSIS

### Active Priorities (from Handover)

The handoff document identifies three active workstreams:

#### P1 — Legal Defense (WYE-001)

- **Deadline:** March 26, 2026 (Discovery response — now passed)
- **Current need:** Psych eval prep is the critical artifact
- **Context:** Court labeled Will "manic" March 18. Psych eval ordered.

#### P2 — Housing Stability (SHELTER-001)

- **Deadline:** April 4, 2026 (Eviction from 401 Powder Horn Rd)
- **Gate:** S2 = April 13 (ESG application deadline)
- **Current need:** ESG application text, ADA event documentation

#### P3 — Revenue/Outreach (DELTA-001)

- **Gates:** D2 (Ko-fi loaded) → D3 (SuperStonk) → D4 (festival)
- **Current state:** Content drafted, needs formatting for posting

### Completed Workstreams (This Session)

From the handoff analysis:
- ✅ N0 PWA → LOVE Bridge (BondingView.tsx wired to LedgerEngine)
- ✅ Worker: D1 Migration (INTEGER → REAL)
- ✅ Worker: Two-Pool (Sovereignty/Performance split)
- ✅ Worker: LoveTransactionDO (Durable Object)
- ✅ BONDING Tests (ambientEngine, spatialAudio, consoleEgg)

### Critical Constraints

From the handoff document:
1. **No military/submarine metaphors** — Will is a DoD civilian, ex-wife's father is Navy (trigger in legal context)
2. **Direct communication** — No corporate pleasantries, curse when needed (punctuation, not aggression)
3. **Execute, don't narrate** — Produce artifacts, not documentation for its own sake
4. **Context is key** — Without context, sophisticated work reads as "manic"; with context, it's genius

## 4. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS DOCUMENTATION

### Purpose

The document (`DIFFERENTIAL_DIAGNOSIS_AuDHD_vs_MANIA.md`) was created to provide the court-ordered psych evaluator with clear criteria to distinguish between bipolar mania and AuDHD hyperfocus.

### Key Points

| Feature | Bipolar Mania | AuDHD Hyperfocus |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Onset | Sudden, episodic | Gradual, triggered |
| Duration | Days-weeks | Can sustain months |
| Sleep | Reduced need (3-4 hrs) | Disrupted but not reduced |
| Output Quality | Low specificity | High specificity, verifiable |
| Reality Testing | Impaired | Intact, seeks verification |
| Self-Awareness | Limited | Extensive (SOULSAFE, RED BOARD) |

### Critical Differentiators

1. **Output Quality:** Subject has 511 tests, independently verified mathematical proofs, Zenodo DOIs — manic patients do not produce peer-reviewed verifiable work
2. **Medical Comorbidity:** Hypoparathyroidism can produce psychiatric symptoms that mimic mood disorders; calcium dysregulation during hearing could explain presentation
3. **Self-Regulatory Systems:** Documented SOULSAFE protocol, spoon budgeting, RED BOARD criteria — mania does not present with intact self-monitoring

### Recommended Evaluation Approach

1. **Rule out medical causes:** Serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, thyroid panel
2. **Use standardized instruments:** YMRS, ADHD-RS-5, AQ-10/RAADS-R, BDI-II, WHODAS 2.0
3. **Collateral information:** Prior diagnostic evaluations, Georgia Advocacy Office intake, beta tester, board member

## 5. ESG APPLICATION STATUS

### Current State

No ESG application has been submitted yet. This is a critical gap given the April 4 eviction deadline.

### ESG Overview

**Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG)** — HUD-funded program providing:
- Street outreach
- Emergency shelter
- Homelessness prevention
- Rapid re-housing

### Georgia ESG Structure

In Georgia, ESG funding flows through:
1. **Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA)** — State ESG program
2. **Local Continuums of Care (CoC)** — Regional allocation
3. **Camden County** would be part of the **Georgia Balance of State CoC**

### Key Requirements Typically Include

- Proof of homelessness or imminent loss of housing
- Income documentation
- Disability documentation (ADA status relevant)
- Clean background check (may vary)

### Critical Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| April 4, 2026 | Eviction from 401 Powder Horn Rd |
| April 13, 2026 | ESG application deadline (estimated) |

### ADA Connection

Will's documented ADA access-to-courts violations (5 incidents including March 18 paramedic denial) may strengthen the application by demonstrating:
- Documented disability
- Ongoing legal proceedings affecting stability
- Need for stable housing to maintain access to court (child custody case)

## 7. CRITICAL PATHS AND BLOCKERS

### Critical Path: Legal → Psych Eval

```
March 18: Court labels "manic", orders psych eval
    ↓
Now: Need differential diagnosis documentation (created)
    ↓
TBD: Court-ordered psych eval date
    ↓
If evaluator gets AuDHD vs mania distinction right: "manic" label flips to vindication
If they get it wrong: Everything harder
```

### Critical Path: Housing → ESG

```
April 4: Eviction date
    ↓
April 13: ESG deadline (estimated)
    ↓
Without housing: FERS correspondence, SSA determination, court filings, children's contact logistics, SNAP/Medicaid recertification all affected
    ↓
Housing is load-bearing infrastructure for entire operation
```

### Critical Path: Funding Pipeline

```
$425 (BLOCKER)
    ↓
Georgia incorporation ($110)
    ↓
IRS Form 1023-EZ ($275)
    ↓
EIN issued
    ↓
SAM.gov registration (3-4 weeks)
    ↓
Federal grants (NIDILRR, NSF, etc.)
```

**Current blockers:**
- $0 in accounts
- Pollination Project ($500) — submitted March 10, no response
- Awesome Foundation ($1,000) — submitted March 10, no response
- Ko-fi Node Count = 0

## 9. COMMUNICATION STYLE PREFERENCES

### From P31_COGNITIVE_PASSPORT.md

- **Direct.** No corporate pleasantries.
- **Curses when emphasis is needed.** It's punctuation, not aggression.
- **NEVER use submarine, naval, or military metaphors.** Will was a DoD CIVILIAN engineer, not military. His ex-wife's father was Navy — it's a trigger in the legal context.

### From Claude Code Handoff

- **Execute, don't narrate.** Produce artifacts, not documentation for its own sake. "You're acting like Gemini" = too verbose, too much planning narration before doing the work.
- **Context is key.** Without context, sophisticated work reads as "manic"; with context, it's genius.
