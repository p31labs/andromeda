## 1. SHOP ITEM RENAMES + DESCRIPTIONS

### Item: as_above_so_below

**New Display Name:**
```
As Above, So Below — Master Topology Print
```

**New Description:**
```
High-resolution digital print of the master visual artifact: the topological 
map of P31 Labs' architecture.

"As above, so below" — the same tetrahedral geometry appears at every scale. 
Quantum coherence in Posner molecules. Structural rigidity in K₄ graphs. 
Fault tolerance in mesh networks. The same four-node complete graph, whether 
you're looking at calcium-phosphate bonds or Cloudflare Worker connections.

This print maps both layers — the theoretical foundation and the engineering 
implementation — showing how they mirror each other. The geometry is 
invariant. Only the medium changes.

High-resolution PNG. The blueprint of everything we build.
```

### Item: k4_convergence_table

**New Display Name:**
```
K₄ Convergence Table — Cross-Domain Proof Print
```

**New Description:**
```
High-resolution digital print of the K₄ convergence table — the cross-domain 
proof that tetrahedral geometry is not a metaphor.

Six domains. One structure. The table maps how the complete graph on four 
vertices (K₄) appears independently in quantum information, structural 
engineering, electrostatics, graph theory, quantum biology, and electrical 
topology. Each domain discovered K₄ through different mathematics, different 
notation, different centuries — and arrived at the same shape.

4 vertices. 6 edges. 1/3 overlap. K₄.

This is the empirical backbone of the Tetrahedron Protocol. It's also a 
sharp-looking poster.

High-resolution PNG.

### Item: floating_neutral_diagram

**New Display Name:**
```
Floating Neutral — Wye-to-Delta Topology Print
```

**New Description:**
```
High-resolution explainer diagram showing the Wye-to-Delta topological 
transformation — the core engineering metaphor of P31 Labs.

In three-phase electrical systems, a Wye (star) topology has a central 
neutral point. If that neutral "floats" — loses its ground reference — the 
entire system becomes unstable. Voltages drift. Equipment burns. The fix: 
convert to Delta (mesh) topology, where every node connects directly to every 
other node. No single point of failure. No floating neutral.

P31 Labs is building the Delta. This diagram shows exactly what that means — 
from the electrical engineering that inspired it to the network architecture 
that implements it.

High-resolution PNG. If you've ever wondered what "ground the floating 
neutral" means, this is the picture.

### Monograph Description Update

**Current item name (keep):**

```

**New Description:**
```
The Minimum Enclosing Structure: Tetrahedral Geometry as Universal 
Architecture from Quantum Coherence to Social Resilience.

The full companion monograph to the Tetrahedron Protocol. Five chapters 
tracing the K₄ complete graph across quantum information, structural 
engineering, graph theory, quantum biology, electrical topology, and network 
resilience.

Written by William R. Johnson, P31 Labs.
DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18627420
ORCID: 0009-0002-2492-9079

39 pages. Peer-linkable. Daubert-ready. Published on Zenodo under open

## 3. SEED POSTS 6-9 — READY TO COPY-PASTE

### POST 6: "Node Zero Is Real"

**Type:** Text + image (photo of Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-3.5B board if available)

```
The Node Zero maker variant is on my desk.

It's a Waveshare ESP32-S3 with a 3.5" QSPI touchscreen, 8MB PSRAM, 
16MB flash. Running ESP-IDF v5.5.3 with LVGL v8.4 for the UI. The 
display driver is for the AXS15231B controller — a chip that barely 
exists in documentation yet.

This week I debugged a heap corruption crash that turned out to be a 
single missing function call. One line: lv_init(). Without it, LVGL's 
memory allocator was a null pointer pretending to be a heap. The crash 
manifested as a LoadProhibited exception at address 0x00000014 — exactly 
20 bytes into a struct that didn't exist.

That's firmware development. Hours of diagnosis for a one-line fix. 
But now the display lights up, the touch responds, and the Coherence 
Arc UI is rendering.

Next: haptic feedback integration (DRV2605L), then LoRa mesh 
(SX1262). The goal is an open-source palm device for sensory 
regulation — something a neurodivergent kid can hold when the world 
gets too loud.

All code is going to github.com/p31labs when the firmware stabilizes.

### POST 7: "Shop Tour — What the Prints Mean"

**Type:** Text + gallery images

```
Quick tour of the Ko-fi shop, since these aren't random art prints.

Every image in the shop is a diagram from the actual P31 Labs 
architecture. They're screenshots of working theory, not decorative 
posters.

🔺 Spaceship Earth — the 3D cognitive dashboard we're building in 
React + Three.js. That wireframe dome is real code.

🔺 SIC-POVM — the quantum measurement structure that proves four 
tetrahedral vectors are enough to reconstruct any quantum state. 
It's the mathematical foundation for why K₄ keeps showing up.

🔺 The Posner Shield — Ca₉(PO₄)₆, the molecule our entire 
organization is named after. The calcium cage that protects 
phosphorus.

🔺 K₄ Convergence Table — six different scientific domains 
discovering the same geometry independently. The empirical proof that 
this isn't a metaphor.

🔺 Floating Neutral — the electrical engineering transformation 
(Wye → Delta) that explains our whole design philosophy in one image.

🔺 As Above, So Below — the master map. Theory on top, engineering 
on bottom, same structure everywhere.

$1 each, pay-what-you-want. Every purchase is a node in the mesh.

### POST 8: "The $425 Problem"

**Type:** Text post

```
Here's the bottleneck.

P31 Labs is a Georgia 501(c)(3) nonprofit — in formation. That means 
the articles aren't filed yet. Here's why:

Georgia Articles of Incorporation: $110
Required newspaper publication: $40
IRS Form 1023-EZ: $275
Total: $425

Until that $425 is spent, P31 Labs has no legal identity. No EIN. No 
IRS determination letter. No SAM.gov registration. No eligibility for 
federal grants.

Every federal grant pathway — NIDILRR, NSF, NIH — requires SAM.gov. 
SAM.gov requires a 501(c)(3) determination letter. The determination 
letter requires the $275 IRS fee. It's a sequential dependency chain 
and the first link costs $425.

I've applied to the Pollination Project ($500 seed grant) and the 
Awesome Foundation ($1,000 micro-grant). Both pending. Either one 
breaks the chain.

In the meantime, every Ko-fi purchase goes into the incorporation 
fund. The node count isn't just a metaphor — it's a treasury meter.

Where we are: [INSERT NODE COUNT] / $425

The math is on Zenodo. The code is on GitHub. The game is live. 
The only thing missing is the legal structure to receive the funding 
that makes everything else sustainable.

💜🔺💜
```

**Note:** Replace `[INSERT NODE COUNT]` with your current supporter count.

### POST 9: "BONDING Quest Chains Explained"

**Type:** Text post + link to bonding.p31ca.org

```
BONDING has three quest chains. Each one teaches chemistry through 
play, with no textbooks and no quizzes.

🌱 THE GENESIS QUEST (Seed mode — ages 5+)
Build water. Build oxygen gas. That's it. Two elements, three 
molecules. A six-year-old can finish this in under five minutes. The 
reward: you understand that hydrogen wants to bond and oxygen wants 
two partners.

🌿 THE KITCHEN QUEST (Sprout mode — ages 8+)
Build baking soda. Build vinegar (acetic acid). Build carbon dioxide. 
Watch the volcano react. Four elements now: hydrogen, carbon, 
nitrogen, oxygen. The molecules get bigger. The patterns get visible.

🌳 THE POSNER QUEST (Sapling mode — advanced)
Build calcium oxide. Build phosphate. Build a Posner molecule — 
Ca₉(PO₄)₆. Fifteen atoms arranged in the exact geometry that 
Matthew Fisher proposed might protect quantum coherence in your brain.

The quest chains aren't unlocked by age gates or settings. The 
difficulty mode IS the element palette. Tap 🌱 and you see hydrogen 
and oxygen. Tap 🌳 and you see everything, including calcium and 
phosphorus.

No kids mode toggle. No dumbing down. The periodic table is the 
difficulty curve.

Play it: bonding.p31ca.org
