## TypeScript Configuration Improvements

### Problem Addressed
- Missing base TypeScript configuration causing inconsistent type checking

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Base TypeScript Configuration (`04_SOFTWARE/tsconfig.base.json`)
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "strict": true,

## Tri-State Camera System

### Problem Addressed
- Limited camera navigation modes in Delta cockpit
- Need for contextual spatial navigation for different interface types

### Solution Implemented

### Architecture
The Tri-State Camera System provides three distinct navigation modes:

1. **Free Orbit Mode**: Standard omnidirectional exploration
2. **Dome Mode**: Bounded orbit around central icosphere structure
3. **Screen Mode**: Parallel to 2D virtual terminal faces with infinite horizontal scroll

### Key Features

#### Core Components (`04_SOFTWARE/spaceship-earth/src/components/TriStateCamera.tsx`)

```typescript
export type CameraMode = 'free' | 'dome' | 'screen';

interface TriStateCameraProps {
  mode: CameraMode;
  target?: THREE.Vector3;
  radius?: number;
  height?: number;
  onModeChange?: (mode: CameraMode) => void;
}
```

#### Mode-Specific Behaviors

**Free Orbit Mode:**
- Standard orbit controls with full pan, rotate, and zoom capabilities
- Distance range: 5-100 units
- Full polar angle range (prevents going below horizon)

**Dome Mode:**
- Locked to bounded orbit around central structure
- Distance range: 15-35 units
- Restricted polar angles to maintain dome constraints
- Prevents camera from going below horizon

**Screen Mode:**
- Locked parallel to 2D virtual terminal faces
- Infinite horizontal scroll capability
- Vertical alignment maintained
- Ctrl+Zoom enabled for precision control

#### Camera Mode Switcher
- Interactive UI component for mode selection
- Visual feedback and descriptions for each mode
- Keyboard shortcuts (Escape to return to Free Orbit)

### Benefits
- Contextual navigation optimized for different interface types
- Enhanced user experience with mode-specific constraints
- Seamless transitions between navigation modes
- Improved spatial awareness in 3D environment

#### Example Data Structure
```typescript
export const createExampleNavigationData = (): SierpinskiNode => ({
  id: 'root',
  label: 'Spaceship Earth',
  level: 0,
  position: [0, 0, 0],
  children: [
    {
      id: 'delta',
      label: 'Delta Cockpit',
      level: 1,
      metadata: { type: 'room', description: 'Primary command interface' },
      children: [
        {
          id: 'tri-state-camera',
          label: 'Tri-State Camera',
          level: 2,
          metadata: { type: 'tool', description: 'Three-mode navigation system' }
