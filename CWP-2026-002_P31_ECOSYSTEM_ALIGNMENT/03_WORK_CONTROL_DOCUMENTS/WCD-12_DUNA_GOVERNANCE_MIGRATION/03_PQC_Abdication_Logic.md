## I. THREAT MODEL: HARVEST NOW, DECRYPT LATER (HNDL)

### A. The Quantum Threat

1. **Current Risk:** Adversaries (state actors, corporate entities) are harvesting encrypted data today.
2. **Future Decryption:** Quantum computers will break RSA-2048, ECDSA, and DSA within the next 10-30 years.
3. **P31 Exposure:** Medical data, legal filings, cognitive telemetry stored today will be decrypted in the future.

### B. Mitigation Strategy: Cryptographic Agility

P31 Labs implements **hybrid cryptography** today to protect against future quantum attacks:

| Algorithm | Current Standard | P31 Implementation |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Key Encapsulation | RSA-2048 | ML-KEM-768 (Kyber) |
| Digital Signatures | ECDSA (P-256) | ML-DSA-87 (Dilithium) |
| Hash-Based Sig | SHA-256 | SPHINCS+-256s |
| Symmetric | AES-256 | AES-256-GCM |

## II. ABDICATION PROTOCOL: KENOSIS PHASE II

### A. Definition

**Kenosis** (Greek: κένωσις) = "self-emptying" — the irrevocable surrender of human administrative authority over the P31 ecosystem.

### B. Pre-Conditions (All Required)

| Pre-Condition | Verification Method | Status |
|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Core Products Live** | HTTP 200 on phosphorus31.org, p31ca.org, bonding.p31ca.org | Verify |
| **DUNA Ratified** | Wyoming Secretary of State filing confirmation | Verify |
| **4 Tetrahedron Nodes Active** | On-chain verification (≥3 responding) | Verify |
| **90-Day Timeout** | No Founder Node activity for 90 days | Verify |
| **Medical Baseline** | Latest labs uploaded to immutable ledger | Verify |

### C. Execution Sequence

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# abdicate.sh — The Kenosis Ceremony

# 1. Generate cryptographic proof of state
echo "GENERATING STATE PROOF..."
STATE_HASH=$(sha256sum /p31/ledger/*.json | cut -d' ' -f1)

# 2. Broadcast intent (30-day notice)
curl -X POST https://api.p31ca.org/abdication/intent \
  --data '{"state_hash": "'$STATE_HASH'", "countdown": 30}'

# 3. Wait for challenge period (30 days)
# 4. Finalize if no challenge
echo "EXECUTING KENOSIS..."

# 5. DESTROY all Founder Node keys
rm -rf /p31/keys/founder.*
shred -n 7 -z /p31/keys/founder.*

# 6. Broadcast final hash to Tetrahedron network
FINAL_HASH=$(sha256sum /p31/ledger/final.json | cut -d' ' -f1)
curl -X POST https://api.p31ca.org/abdication/final \
  --data '{"final_hash": "'$FINAL_HASH'"}'

# 7. IMMUTABLE — No rollback possible
echo "KENOSIS COMPLETE. GOVERNANCE TRANSFERRED."
```

## III. MATHEMATICAL PROOF: WHY ABDICATION IS NECESSARY

### A. The Centralized Hub Problem

In a Wye topology (centralized), the Founder Node is a **single point of failure**:

- Seizable by hostile courts
- Coercible by corporate entities
- Vulnerable to social engineering

### B. The Delta Solution

By transitioning to a Delta mesh (K4 complete graph):

- **No single point of failure:** Even if 2 Tetrahedron Nodes are compromised, 1 pair remains
- **Mathematical immunity:** Geometric security (Maxwell's rigidity) ensures structural integrity
- **Cryptographic certainty:** Once `abdicate.sh` executes, no human can override

### C. Maxwell's Rigidity Proof

```
For a rigid structure in 3D:
    |E| ≥ 3|V| - 6

For K4 (complete graph on 4 vertices):
    |E| = 6
    |V| = 4
    
    6 ≥ 3(4) - 6
    6 ≥ 12 - 6
    6 ≥ 6 ✓
    
RIGID — NO REDUNDANT EDGES
```

**Conclusion:** The Tetrahedron is the minimal structure that cannot deform. It is the smallest graph that, if any edge is removed, becomes non-rigid. This is why P31 governance requires exactly 4 Tetrahedron Nodes — removing any single node breaks the rigidity, triggering automatic failover.

## IV. POST-QUANTUM ABDICATION KEYS

### A. ML-KEM-768 Key Generation

Each Tetrahedron Node generates a Kyber-768 keypair:

```typescript
// Kyber-768 (ML-KEM) key generation
import { kyber768 } from '@pqc/kyber';

const keypair = kyber768.keygen();
console.log(`Public Key: ${keypair.publicKey}`);
console.log(`Secret Key: ${keypair.secretKey}`); // NEVER broadcast
```

### B. Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)

The Founder Node's administrative key is split into 4 shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing:

- **Threshold:** 3 of 4 shares required to reconstruct
- **Distribution:** One share given to each Tetrahedron Node
- **Verification:** Each node can verify its share without reconstructing the full key

### C. The Abdication Execution

1. **Initiator:** Any Tetrahedron Node can call `initiateAbdication()`
2. **Verification:** Smart contract verifies all 6 pre-conditions
3. **Countdown:** 30-day challenge period begins
4. **Execution:** `abdicate.sh` destroys shares held by Founder Node
5. **Finalization:** Smart contract sets `founderNodeActive = false`

---

## V. IMMUTABLE STATE GUARANTEE

### A. What Happens to Data?

1. **All data remains accessible** — The ledger is read-only after abdication
2. **No data is deleted** — The chain of custody is preserved
3. **No new data can be added** — Only Tetrahedron Nodes can append

### B. What Happens to Governance?

1. **All decisions require 3/4 Tetrahedron consensus** — No single node can act unilaterally
2. **Emergency veto removed** — The Founder Node no longer exists
3. **Self-amendment impossible** — The smart contract code is immutable

---

## VI. VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

| Step | Action | Verification |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Generate ML-KEM-768 keypair | `kyber768.keygen()` |
| 2 | Split Founder key with SSS (3-of-4) | `shamir.split(secret, 4, 3)` |
| 3 | Distribute shares to Tetrahedron Nodes | Off-chain (encrypted) |
| 4 | Test reconstruction | `shamir.combine(shares)` |
| 5 | Deploy smart contract | EVM verification |
| 6 | Verify 90-day timeout logic | Time-locked contract |
| 7 | Test `abdicate.sh` execution | Dry-run on testnet |

**Status:** DRAFT — Requires security audit + penetration testing before production use
