## Production Patches (Verified)

### PATCH 1: localStorage Eviction
- **Problem:** Chrome evicts localStorage, destroying hash chain
- **Solution:** IndexedDB via idb-keyval + navigator.storage.persist() + custom merge
- **Location:** `genesis.ts:46-50`, `worker/telemetry.ts:577`

### PATCH 2: KV Session Handling
- **Problem:** KV shared index loses sessions during concurrent writes
- **Solution:** Per-session unique keys + KV.list() for discovery
- **Location:** `worker/telemetry.ts:5,117-118,284-286`

### PATCH 3: sendBeacon Drops
- **Problem:** sendBeacon drops 5-15% of mobile sessions on exit
- **Solution:** 30s incremental flush + IDB backstop on visibilitychange/freeze + orphan recovery
- **Location:** `genesis.ts:9`, `gameSync.ts:507`, `worker/telemetry.ts:234`

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Delta over Wye:** Mesh topology over centralized — resilient, no single point of failure
2. **Local-first:** Zero-trust, data sovereignty via IndexedDB + PGLite
3. **Room Router:** Hash-based navigation, `ROOMS` array = single source of truth
4. **Z-Index Contract:** Cockpit doctrine — Canvas z1, HUD z10, Toasts z50, Modals z60
